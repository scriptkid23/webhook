# webhook

Webhook Handler in Rust

This repository contains a webhook handler implemented in Rust, utilizing the best practices of design patterns to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability of webhook integrations.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** The webhook handler is designed using modular components following the principles of separation of concerns. Each component focuses on a specific task, making the codebase easy to understand and maintain.

- **Design Patterns:** The implementation leverages various design patterns such as Observer, Factory, and Builder to address common challenges encountered in webhook handling, ensuring flexibility and extensibility.

- **Asynchronous Processing:** The handler is built using asynchronous programming techniques provided by Rust's async/await syntax, allowing it to efficiently handle multiple incoming webhook requests concurrently.

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to gracefully manage errors and failures, ensuring the reliability of the webhook handling process.

- **Extensive Documentation:** The codebase is thoroughly documented, providing insights into the design decisions, usage instructions, and guidelines for extending or customizing the webhook handler.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the webhook handler, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Build the Project:** Use Cargo, Rust's package manager, to build the project by running `cargo build`.

3. **Configure Webhook Endpoints:** Modify the configuration file to specify the webhook endpoints you want to handle.

4. **Run the Application:** Execute the built binary to start the webhook handler application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will start listening for incoming webhook requests according to the configured endpoints. You can customize the behavior of the webhook handler by implementing additional components or modifying existing ones to suit your requirements.
